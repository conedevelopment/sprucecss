## What is Spruce CSS?

- It is a Sass-based, small framework that operates with just a few utility classes.
- It takes advantage of the Sass members: variables, mixins, and functions.
- It embraces Sass modules, so it uses @use and namespacing for import.
- It is relatively small. Right now just over 1000 lines, but it will expand in the future. As we see right now, the maximum is somewhere near 2000 lines of code.
- It is modern. By modern, we mean using the newest CSS features like the grid, aspect-ratio, logical properties, etc.
- The generated CSS code is separated from the framework. You can use only the tools (variables, mixins, functions) in your project [without the generated styles](https://sprucecss.com/docs/elements/generators).
- It uses just a few classical components (form elements mostly). We plan a separate component library for Spruce named UI.
- [It comes with dark-mode](https://sprucecss.com/docs/customization/themes) (or any theme mode) support. It uses CSS custom properties, so it isn’t that hard to create a new color theme.
- It doesn’t come with a classical grid system.

## How to start with Spruce?

Firstly, we suggest checking out the documentation, precisely the [installation page](https://sprucecss.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

There is nothing new if you previously used Sass unless you don’t know the newer [module system](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched).

To start a new Spruce-based project (or experiment), we suggest using our [starter kit](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss-starter-kit) containing a simple Sass build environment.
